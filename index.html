                absorbed through our digestive tract for use by the body.Food conataining carbohydrates and sugars are broken down into glucose.To be able to use glucose for fuel,glucose must be get into our cells.
                The pancreas produces a hormone called insulin,which is a chemical messenger essential for the entry of glucoe into cells as the blood glucose levels rise after  the meal insulin is releases into the bloodstream and sets processes in motion to trigger the removal of glucose from the blood 
                to enter into the cells.In Type-2 Diabetes the cells become resistant to insulin and ignore its message to absorb glucose this is known as insulin resistant.In type 2 diabetes  the pancreas is unable to produce the greater amount of insulin  needed to trigger these resistant cells to take inglucose from the bloodstream.The most noticeable symptom of diabetes is frequent urination leading to thirst and increased liquid intake  and excessive thirst and blurred vision.
